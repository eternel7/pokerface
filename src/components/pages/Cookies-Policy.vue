      <p>
        5.1 As well as cookies, we use other technologies to recognise and track visitors to our Sites. A web beacon
        (also

        delivered

        track access to our communications, to understand whether users have come to our Sites from an online
        advertisement
        displayed on a third-party website, to measure how ads have been viewed and to improve site performance.
